# Fresh Mart Online Grocery application

FRESH MART is an Android mobile application which runs on an Android platform 
with Internet support. In this project, the FRESH MART 
Android application helps people avoid having to stand in a long 
queue by:

(1) Allow the user to find the desired item or grocery and putting 
them into the cart . 

(2) Then confirm the selected items they wish to purchase 
finally.

(3) Confirm the purchase and pay their bill using Cash On 
Delivery [C.O.D] .

(4) Generate a receipt for the purchased items.

## Need on this application :

In the year 2020 we faced a pandemic around the 
worldwide. The outbreak of COVID-19 caused everyone to 
stay their home. But to live we require food and to buy food 
it is necessary to go out of the home and buy the grocery item 
t make food and eat. Thus, to bring vegetable or groceries 
everyone had to get out of the house and buy items.
Thus, it creates crowd in the market and thereâ€™s a possibility 
of spreading the virus. 

Currently, there exists many applications like grofers , jiomart to help people know their wait time and where there is 
no need to stand in their long queue and provide groceries 
to the users using online mode. But the only problem is that 
those available services are only available in big cities . 
But for the people of small cities there must need to be same 
facilities where they also can shop online and be the 
technology friendly people .
